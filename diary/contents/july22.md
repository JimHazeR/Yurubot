## Setting fixed ip address
In initial setting, Jetson nano's ip adress is not fixed.  
But that is not convenient because it is used by ssh and vnc connection.  
So I fixed it.
### How to
1. Open Network Connections Setting
2. Click gear icon
3. When open new window, open IPv$ Settings tab
4. Change to manual
5. Please set Adress, Netmask, Gateway, and DNS Server
