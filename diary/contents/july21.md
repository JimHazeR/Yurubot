## I powered on Jetson nano
Jetson nano is our main board in Yurubot.  
It is a shop where we bought it.
* Jetson nano [Buy in Akituki Denshi](http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gM-14393/)
* 5V 4A Power Cable [Buy in Akituki Denshi](http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gM-06238/)

※Jetson nano can move 5V2A with micro-usb  
but if you are want to use it more high power,  
it needs 5V4A. Jetson nano has DC conecter, 2.1ｘ5.5ｘ9.5(mm) center plus.  
If you use it, please connect J48 jamper pin.
